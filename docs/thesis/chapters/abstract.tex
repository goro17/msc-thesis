\chapter*{Abstract}

The landscape of modern computing has increasingly shifted torwards distributed
architectures to meet the demand of high availability and real-time collaboration.
Traditional approaches to data synchronization often rely on centralized strategies, such
as Operational Transformation (OT). This thesis provides a more sensible approach by
exploring Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), which are data structures backed
by sound mathematical frameworks, and guarantee Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) in
decentralized environments, without the need for a central authority.

To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, this work presents the design and
implementation of a Proof-of-Concept replicated file storage system. The system
simulates a peer-to-peer network, where file contents and metadata are synchronized
across multiple replicas connected to the same network. A distinguishing feature of the
PoC is the integration of a cryptographic digital scheme mechanism, which enables users
to assert ownership of files and allows peers to perform validity checks on shared data.
