\chapter{Design and Implementation of the Proof-of-Concept Application}

Whereas the previous chapters were dedicated in providing a comprehensive literature
review on the topic, we will now focus on the practical implementations of integrating
solutions based on CRDTs in distributed software. In order to achieve this, we will
analyze a use case in which the implementation of CRDT-based data structures proves to be
\textit{valuable}, and document the development of a Proof-of-Concept application built
around that use case.
% TODO: replace the word valuable with something different 

\section{Defining the Use Case for the Proof-of-Concept}

The traditional infrastructure behind the broad family of collaborative applications --
e.g., editors such as the Google Docs suite, Dropbox, and many more -- keeps increasing
in complexity, in order to accomodate an ever increasing number of users that make use of
these systems over the World Wide Web.
